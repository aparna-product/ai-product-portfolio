# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Sandbox

**Goal:** Try different prompts with ChatGPT and see which gives the best results.

**Example Prompts:**
- "Summarize this text in one line."
- "Explain this like I’m 10 years old."
- "Write this in a professional tone."
- "List 3 insights from this paragraph."

**What I did:**
- Tested different prompts on ChatGPT manually.
- Noted which gave best accuracy or clarity.
- Observed how structure, context, and tone change results.

**Key Learnings:**
- Specific, structured prompts give better answers.
- Giving examples (“few-shot”) helps models stay on topic.
- Temperature (creativity level) changes tone significantly.
