# 🎯 Fine-Tuning Demo

**Goal:** Understand how companies customize AI models to their domain.

**What fine-tuning means:**
- It’s like teaching ChatGPT your company’s style or tone.
- You feed it many example inputs + desired outputs.
- The model learns to respond the same way next time.

**Example use case:**
- You have 200 customer support chats.
- You fine-tune an AI model so it answers like your support team.

**Key Learnings:**
- Use fine-tuning when you need consistency and brand tone.
- For changing topics, prefer RAG (cheaper + flexible).
- Track improvements using metrics like accuracy or F1 score.

**Why it matters to PMs:**
- Knowing when to fine-tune vs. when to use RAG is a key product decision.
- It affects cost, scalability, and speed of delivery.
